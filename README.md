# MotorizedDustCap
Arduino based motorized dust cap project

This project has different components, one component is a 3D print motor bracket and dust cap and the other component is an arduino based 
control of the cap. The communication code is based on https://github.com/jwellman80/ArduinoLightbox

So far I have tested the code using:
* Voyager

I have created caps for:
* TOA150
* FSQ106EDX4

I am currenly working on a more sofisticated project to create a cap for a RASA11
